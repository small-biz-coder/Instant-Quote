Online Quote Generator 

https://wptestforab.com/ try it out at this link.

I crested a React project to generate an online quote instantly, and send a pdf to the client with details of the new quote. We use google maps to view the clients yard and draw an outline of the yard to get an accurate size. Then gather a few other relevant details and calculate the size of the yard to produce a price. It then creates a pdf and sends it to the email provided by the customer. It also works as a tool to provide customer data, to help the business owner follow up, and get to know more of there needs.

This project includes it's own node.js server to send the email to the customer, and to the business owner with the customers name, email, phone number, and address.
