Online Quote Generator 

https://wptestforab.com/ try it out at this link.

I crested a React project to generate an online quote instantly, and send a pdf to the client with details of the new quote. We use google maps to view your yard and draw an outline of said yard to get an accurate size. Then gather a few other relevant details and do some math to produce a price. It then creates a pdf an sends it to the email provided by the customer.
